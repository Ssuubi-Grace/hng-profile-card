                <h2>My Bio & Background</h2>
                <p>I am Grace Ssuubi, a dedicated frontend developer in training. My journey began with a two-year Diploma in Water Engineering, which cultivated my analytical skills and a passion for practical problem-solving. Transitioning to a BSc in Computer Science has allowed me to merge that analytical mindset with the world of technology, specifically focusing on creating impactful and user-centric digital experiences.</p>

                <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
                <p>While I am confident in HTML/CSS, my lower confidence currently lies in advanced <b>Asynchronous JavaScript (</b>Promises, async/await) and deeply integrating with <b>REST APIs</b>. I am actively focusing on these areas to ensure they don't become roadblocks in later stages.</p>

                <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
                <p>Dear Future Grace, remember this feeling of excitement mixed with pressure. Embrace the challenge, ask smart questions, and don't be afraid to break things (and then fix them!). Consistency over intensity. Keep building, keep learning, and keep inspiring.</p>

                <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
                <p>The transition from Stage 0 to Stage 1 has already taught me the importance of code modularity and file structure, which will be crucial for managing larger applications. I'm excited to apply validation logic in the next pageðŸ¥°</p>
